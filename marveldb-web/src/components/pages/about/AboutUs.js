				<strong>Marvel API: </strong><a href="https://developer.marvel.com/">https://developer.marvel.com/</a><br/>
				The Marvel API made it really easy to get the data we needed. Their object models are very similar to our internal ones,
				so getting the static data was as trivial as searching their API for some instances of the models, copying the JSON, and
				modifying the values a small amount.
